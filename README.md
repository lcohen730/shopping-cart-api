# Shopping Cart API
**Unit 2 Solo Project for General Assembly Software Engineering Immersive**

## Getting Started

### Global Installations Needed

#### Node.js

Before installing the app itself, you will need to install node.js globally on your machine:
* Node.js is a runtime environment that is used to execute JavaScript outside of the browser
* If you have "homebrew" installed already, you can just type the command "brew install node" in your Terminal, and that will install node.js for you. To verify node.js is installed, type the command "node -v".
* If you don't have homebrew, you can install the latest version of node.js by navigating to the [node.js website](https://nodejs.org/en) and clicking on the "current" button to download.

### Other Steps Needed Before Cloning

#### MongoDB Atlas
You will also need a MongoDB Atlas account to store your API databases. If you don't have one, you can sign up [here](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas/register). Follow the steps to create your free cluster and database user.

## Installing the App on Your Local Machine

### Clone this Repository

#### Steps to Clone
* Near the top of this page, click the green button that says "Code"
* Copy the HTTPS link shown by clicking on the two overlapping squares

* Type “git clone “ then paste the link copied earlier
* Press enter to create your local clone

### Install Dependencies

#### Steps to Install Dependencies with npm

* To make sure the clone was successful, you can type the “ls” command to view all of the directories and files
* Type “npm i” to install all dependencies needed
