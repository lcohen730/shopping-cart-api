### How to Install This App on Your Local Machine

#### Global Installations Needed

Before installing the app itself, you will need to install node.js globally on your machine:
* Node.js is a runtime environment that is used to execute JavaScript outside of the browser
* If you have "homebrew" installed already, you can just type the command "brew install node" in your Terminal, and that will install node.js for you. To verify node.js is installed, type the command "node -v".
* If you don't have homebrew, you can install the latest version of node.js by navigating to the [node.js website](https://nodejs.org/en) and clicking on the "current" button to download.
